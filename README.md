# Loans_Analysis
This project is about analyzing a dataset with a lot of features about people who want a loan. I analyzed this data with these libraries:
1-Pandas library
2-Seaborn library
I used pandas library for cleaning data, turns data into information and for geting relationships between different types of data.
I used seaborn library for putting data into a chart, graph, or other visual format that helps inform analysis and interpretation.
